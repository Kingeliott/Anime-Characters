#Anime Cards

one of my earliest self made projects. nothing crazy, super super simple, but i realt enjoy the layout and how clean it looks. as well as the background
colors semi matching the characters and appearing in order. the little sound effects on the clicks is a nice touch but for one of my first ever projects I enjoy it
